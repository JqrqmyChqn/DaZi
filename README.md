##Domain:
Our app is a social networking platform designed for university students, 
focusing on connecting them through a “buddy pairing” system. Students can use the 
platform to find like-minded individuals for various activities, such as academic work, 
gaming, or attending social events. By helping students connect, the platform aims to enrich 
both their academic and social experiences. Additionally, our app is intended specifically for 
university students, with all users required to verify their student status, ensuring a safe 
and trusted environment for collaboration and socialization.


## Software Specification:
The app allows university students to sign up using their verified school email addresses. 
Once registered, users will be able to browse, post, and search for buddy opportunities in 
several categories such as academic work, gaming, meal-sharing, and social events.

- Students can sign up for an account. User must sign up with their university email, 
and the app will verify their status before granting access. Once they sign up, users can sign in or sign out.

- Each user will have a basic profile showing their personal information such as attending school, 
location, age, and any relevant information they choose to share, such as their interests or previous activities.

- Users can create posts (invitations) where they specify what kind of buddy they are looking for, 
including details like the activity type, time, and any relevant preferences. Once posted, other users should be 
able to see and respond to the invitation on a specific page.

- Users can select the appropriate category when creating a post (e.g., Learning Buddy, Gaming Buddy, etc.). 
This ensures that posts are organized by type of activity and that other users can browse the intrested invitations.

- Users should be able to search for specific posts using filters such as category, date, and location.

- Users will receive notifications when there are responses to their posts or when new posts match their interests.
